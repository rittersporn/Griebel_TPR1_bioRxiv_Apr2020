bigwig file that can be used as input for IGV (Arabidopsis TAIR10 genome version) to examine enrichment of TPR1-GFP at genes of interest

TPR1-GFP binding in pTPR1:TPR1-GFP Col-0 plants:
File location - 
File name - "substr_TPR1_WT_bs1.bw"
The file contains input-normalized TPR1-GFP ChIP-seq data. The initial BAM files were readCount-scaled (defaulf in bamCompare), and
normalization to the input was performed with the --operation subtract option (see below).
--binSize was set to 1 to ensure reasonable resolution of the ChIP profiles, although this increased the file size.
bamCompare -b1 TPR1_WT.bam -b2 WT_input.bam -o substr_TPR1_WT_bs1.bw --operation subtract --binSize 1
